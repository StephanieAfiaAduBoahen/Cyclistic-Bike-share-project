# Cyclistic-Bike-share-project
# About Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown.
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations
across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
they believe that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, they believe
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. 

# The business problem 
How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

# Tools used for project 
R Studio and Tableau

# Observation and conclusion:
1. Members total number of rides during the week is more than casual users. 
2. On weekends, both casual riders and members typically ride for longer periods of time.
3. Casual rider’s duration on bikes is greater than members.
4. Compared to casual riders, members typically use more types of bikes, including electric, docked, and classic bikes. Casual riders prefer electric bikes to classic bikes.
